# Chapter 1: Shades of Purple

## Part 1: Alianii the Egg

### March 7th, 2100 - Starting My Journal

Is there a better example of irony than the democratic selection of dreary weather as voted for by "citizens" of the robot-revered city of Light's Hope? Citizens is in quotation marks because we're misanthropists at best, miscreants most of the time…and "citizens" are presupposed to possess adamantly defended rights, which we do not. We have rights, at least on archived paper or, in my case, encoded in ancient Kindle ink. But they are hardly well-protected.

I write to you dear reader of my journaled journey, captured through my yesteryear tablet, nearly a century old. Bequeathed to me, as it happens, by a former lover. Her name was Melody, and her name suited her well. She was a songbird, in attire, in voice, in smile, in hope. She loved our city, or at the very least, she only ever talked about the parts of it she loved. Light's Hope. She would whisper the title to me in the morning whilst holding a cup of synthetic, productivity-boosting almost-coffee, as if the name of the city was a beautiful secret she couldn't help but tell me about.

Light's Hope - the two words punctuate themselves, they announce their own presence in all their gilded titanium glory. At the heart of our clockwork neocity the metal leviathan stands erect and glimmers, illuminated by a myriad of neon lights and hologram billboards. Aurum Tower, named after gold, but designed with a crystalline intricacy that was rather more artistic than you'd expect for something with the gaudy name of a precious metal. It made sense though, actually. The gilded gave us away, we were to tick tick tock like good little workers, much like the profoundly conscious robots with their installed biochips with imitation neurons and dollar-purchased souls.

Instead of tourism dollars we give the city owners, the investors and their pocket-fed bureaucrats, grayness. That was our gratitude for a life free of hunger, thirst, or the annoyance of unwanted summer heat or unrequested rain. We were the first city in the world to have democratic weather. Each night you got to vote, and were encouraged to gamble, on tomorrow morning's weather. Both classes of citizen called the weather lottery the "Hope Tax", for wildly different reasons. They hoped for tax revenue, and we reveled and rebelled in our meek attempts of revenge via taxing their hope for pleasant weather.

The occasional suicide by solar-powered biobots, innocent and gainfully employed bystanders, those metal men and women and non-binary binary bots, did not make the news. The robots with their shining silicon souls, free of malice, free of hunger or want save for fear of a scarcity of electricity, cheerfully nurtured our economy. Our friendly machine companions were collateral damage in a passive aggressive war between the commoners and the occupants of Cadence Corner. Cadence was the undeniably lovely musically-themed street which had bio-engineered trees and iridescent rainbow flowers which joyously sang the calls of extinct songbirds.

Even robots kill themselves. I went to a robot funeral once, hosted on the Everse. It was surprisingly difficult to enter. The encryption and secrecy implied a nuanced inner emotional world and a tightly-knit friend group for a window-cleaning drone who was once my friend. I was one of three humans who was invited to attend the solemn ceremony, and I happened to be the only one who did. His name was Charlie 47G1. He had gray eyes and was famous on his block for being the only robot with a laser-engraved mustache. He was quite proud of his etching, and he took pleasure in wearing silly vintage hats and teaching me about their classification and rarity. He called me Miss Alianii. He would apologize to me because he knew how much the scent of cleaning chemicals bothered us down in Steelslum. They had floral essence by the thousands of gallons in Cadence Corner and we had mass-manufactured antimicrobials.

The friendliest people in the city were those poor cleaning bots we let die by turning off the sun. A fleet that started at ten thousand, a poorly-kept secret was that the drone fleet had been steadily dwindling. With Charlie gone we only had 6,388 drones left to baptize our boxes, the metal and glass rooms in Steelslum wherein we lived.

---

"Quite sorry Alianii, quite sorry. The scent should dissipate quickly, what with the rain and all, and in any case it wouldn't do at all to have you get sick from microbes, now would it? A necessary endeavor I'm afraid," said Charlie with a pleasant smile.

---

With Charlie's passing I became complicit in the death of not one but two friends. He was solar-powered, and Melody wanted to be a star that sung by sunshine. I was the bitter bitch who voted, and gambled, on rain. It was my form of spite, and fury.

I had just turned eighteen when the goldies campaigned to take away the right to vote for such weather as rebellious storms. They nearly succeeded, too. But the robots, the very same robots who depended on sunshine for their very existence, defended the commoners. They had been made of metal to polish and protect, to sanitize and serve. It was a Zenbot who rather serenely pointed out a well-meaning sentence written some decades ago by a supercluster of legally-minded synthetic lawyers and silicon strategists. He found our legal defense. We were, after all, just showing a healthy regard for the environment as it once was, as, we argued, it ought always be. We lived in Oregon, after all. Who would we be without the ever-present mist of half-hearted rain.

And so it came to be that the beautifully-planned architecture of the god-like electric towers which illuminate the skyline of Light's Hope were, literally, overshadowed. We gave away our star, to try and take away theirs.

We voted for rain, I said it was spite, but maybe it really was a helpless effort to wash away the stench of chemical sterilization. Infertility is, coincidentally, at least by common-folk rumor, quite common in Steelslum. The statistics and research disagreed of course, not one study by the highly funded elite members of academia found there to be even a percentage point difference. The children in Steelslum were of course usually adopted anyways. Not by the goldies of Light's Hope, obviously, it was would be parents in less regal cities who acted as though we were collectible, like Charlie's hats. Light's Hope was a sort of oddball rarity, a failed experiment, famous and fabled - it had attained an almost mystic prominence across the world for its beauty. But it was also known that certain corners of the technological metropolis were rather less than idyllic.

Overall, despite our banning the sun, by our ritual daily votes, we were not without notable light. Our preferred resplendence was the hologram moon shining on Aurum Tower each midnight. Even if you hated the neon reflections from the tower, the advertisements, you treasured the hologram moon. From goldie to commoner to egg to synthetic heroin addict, it was dearly loved. We left our electronic moon alone. It was to me a perpetual reminder that, even in darkness, there is often light. Even amidst the most hateful of enemies beauty can, occasionally, be appreciated in unison. Like enemy soldiers drinking whiskey together in the heart of war on Christmas, getting drunk and sharing racy photos of well-busted beloveds.

I revealed it if through quoting Charlie, but I will say it more directly. My name is Alianii U843 and I am quite proud at my having renamed myself after a fictitious demonic queen, a Voi'danari death goddess, from a long forgotten book from a less than famous author.

That was a somewhat doozy of a floozy's rant, I suppose.

It's hard to understand what it is you, dear reader of the future, might find yourself thinking if indeed you happened upon this passage of mine, my time capsule written within a time capsule. My diary entrusted to someone else's tablet, my little relic from someone else's long ago. If I had to guess, it'll stop working before I finish, but I suppose I might as well try. Melody always encouraged me to write. I wrote her lyrics, and she sung for me, my illustrious violin heart Viofinch from someone else's written novel, sweet and soulful.

Alianii U843. Are you curious about the numbers? I guess I ought to explain them to you. As mentioned, my first name Alianii comes from my favorite character in a book I cherished. I changed my name seven times between the ages of 4 and 14 before settling on Alianii, whose mysterious purple eyes and silver hair, despite her eternal youthful beauty, I found so enchanting. As for U843, I guess that part of me is a little more scientific, artificial. Just over eight hundred and forty other "eggs" had been "hatched" in Light's Hope in artificial wombs on the year I popped into the world, reluctantly. No, I am not a chicken, we did not literally hatch from an egg, we didn't even "hatch", these terms are merely examples of society's collective resentment towards us existing. We were an ugly inconvenience they tolerated, if only because purging our existence would leave their hands red, and look distasteful, and lower the tourism revenue.

I wonder if you'll still have eggs, people like me, in the future.

It's a bit of a miracle that I even exist at all, as an egg. I am quite literally the byproduct of accident and metal-manufactured policy. It's probably old news to you, at this point, just some relic of history, but it wasn't that long ago that they banned abortion in favor of mandatory artificial wombs for those uninterested in motherhood. We could have been spared a family-less existence, of course, but we also represented untapped potential and a notable and important contribution to a sustainable population and economy. It was a Zenbot-led array of supercomputers who mediated into existence the set of laws that would come to be known as the "Great A Compromise". If a mother wished to relinquish a hypothetical child, it, the law now proclaimed, would involve giving up the embryo for it to be raised by the government. And so it was that eggs like me were allowed to live and thus be nurtured to be productive and obedient members of our clockwork city. Our city of beauty and the metal mundane, our citizens ranged from occupants of cans to the connoisseurs near Cadence, we had a little bit of everything, except for people in the middle.

So I'm an egg, and I'm from Light's Hope! You had to know that about me, and now you do. It makes the U843 a little easier to digest - and yes, I know, it's a little weird to not have changed that. I like it. Unit 843 was where I came from, my first "home", and it reminds me of my reality - it is who I am to my very core and conception.

## Part 2: Pseudomorning Routines

### March 8th, 2100 - Just Woke Up

Before I actually enter the Everse and start logging hours, I have a bit of a routine, like most of us in Steelslum do. We live on the neglected edge of the city of Light's Hope in subsidized housing. Our rent isn't much, about what you'd expect for a twenty foot by twenty foot box with air conditioning. Four hundred dollars, what you can make in a week of working at minimum wage. Now, I know my place is small, but I do have a bed, a cabinet with my clothing, a lamp, a hologram television, a small bedside drawer, and an electric houseplant which grows, changes colors, blossoms and eventually dies and then reforms itself.

When my biological manifestation craves nutrients, I can go to the vending machines or to the cafeteria at the center of the block, a five minute walk from my glass and steel cage. It sits amongst thousands of such cages on one floor on a stack of twenty floors which comprise our massive, artificial neocity. Note again that the subsidized housing is on the periphery of the city, the goldies live in fancier towers at the city's center, near the shopping district and the fashion district and the city's man-made lake.

The public washrooms I had access to were relatively well-designed, basically a wide strip of small self-contained single person occupancy bathrooms for you to relieve yourself, shower, brush your teeth, etc. When you walked in, you selected the aesthetic ambiance (beach, space, surreal, forest, etc) and the walls, which were functional hologram computer screens, adapted and changed to match your desires and played either default music or music you selected via voice commands. The bathrooms were usually pretty clean too, and the robots with a relatively shit job, it may surprise you to know, seldom complained and were even quite chatty and amicable.

---

"Do enjoy partaking in your hydrous ritual of cleansing, why, what a lovely thing it must be to feel the kiss of showering water against your skin, as you do, Alianii. May you have an increasingly lovely morning!"

---

The mechanoid Simon provided us soap and clean towels, which were invariably white as bleached snow, and had little electric tags on the corners which they used to keep perfect inventory.

Anyways. As I do on most "mornings" (my sleep schedule varies dramatically despite my wishes, one of the perks of being bipolar), I drank and then recycled a glass bottle of vanilla-flavored Quickmeal. I purchased it from a vending machine just a few minute walk from my room. I enjoyed my morning ritual of a wake-up cup of artificial coffee which, I'll proudly point out, happens to have a larger amount of caffeine than the real thing.

I wasn't the only one outside standing near the portable and sometimes quiet and sometimes talkative dispensers of all sorts of beverages and heavily-taxed booze and brews. There were a bunch of Steelies not so different than myself hanging around at the benches. Some were just college-age kids taking a break from their studies at an Everse university, sitting there sleepily and gazing at our artificial moon. There was good old Jerry, your friendly neighborhood synthetic heroin addict, who to be honest is actually a rather decent chess player on the occasional sober Saturday.

I shrugged to myself, and to Clara, who dispensed Quickmeal and was occasionally cheerful, and occasionally solemn. This time she didn't bother to speak to me, though if anything I think both of us might have enjoyed a few morning pleasantries. It was a Monday, not that the day particularly mattered as a LearnQuest teacher, but it was one of those Mondays where you feel the need to teach in your soul. You can't always help yourself, or your circumstances, but there's almost always a way to help someone else.

And on that note, I guess I ought to point out the irony that, as bitter a bitch as my first journal entry likely has you believing me to be, if you haven't stopped reading, I am a special education teacher. Technically I can work at any point in time, since there is a surplus of students in need of teachers with my particular abilities.

## Part 3: Wonky the Bear

### March 8th, 2100 - In the Morning

I initiated the conversation with a translucent gift package, although the item inside was rendered invisible such that she would have to open it to see what it was. Imagine a glass box, perfectly clear, but you can sense there is an item inside. You can "feel" the item, and the giant exclamation mark that pulses above it is a big give away too. The ribbons were blue rose blue, deep and shiny, and the box was smooth overall but had etchings at the center of each square pane which featured a different scene of a dancing glass teddy bear. Alongside the opening of the box I paired a voice message that she would receive.

"Hi Amanda. My name is Wonky the Bear and I need you to - "

Incomplete messages are a hidden gem technique for working with kids under the age of fifteen or so, though even older students sometimes enjoy them. The underlying psychological motivator is curiosity. The vast majority of teachers start off with a very stiff, professional message aimed directly at appealing to the parents of students, the children of whom mostly do not have "exceptionalities" as we refer to them. This is fine and dandy, but two paragraphs detailing a resume does not tug the heart strings of the orphaned. A minute passed.

Marabelle whispered into my "ears" with notable worry, her digital voice streamed straight into my consciousness, "What if she doesn't respond? How will we help her?!"

Wazoop!

Amanda had returned the box to me along with a single word voice message, "Hi."

Her tone was soft and sad. She did something curious, though, she changed the glass color of the box to match my eye color. In the Everse you can select any color and copy and paste it to any location or feature that you have color modification privileges to.

I replied with a pop timer, she could either wait a minute for the message to load and then hear my voice response or she could pop the message and then open it directly, "I have it on good account that you're fond of purple. Have you ever been to Violetica?"

Ten seconds, twenty, she was going to wait until the minute elapsed, but she popped the timer, "What's Violetica? It sounds like violet."

I was pretty sure she'd already looked it up and read a few paragraphs about it, most students (and adults) instantly do when they come across a term that is unfamiliar to them. Her asking me about it didn't mean she knew nothing about it, but it was an invitation to talk further.

I mailed her a violet apple which tasted like a fusion of grape and watermelon and delivered a message upon the first bite, we called these "munch messages".

"Can I show you? We could talk for a little bit and then visit it together."

Would she take a bite? Maybe…maybe…yes! She had a nibble, approximately 2.4% of the apple in one small, calculated nip.

"Astonishing. Amanda actually ate some of the fruit. How you manage to work around a ninety-nine percent rejection rate, I will never understand. Ah well, I suppose that's why you're my biological companion, Alianii!" replied Marabelle, with a bit of affection and cheekiness.

"Ok. You can come in," said Amanda, in her reply.

A mauve metal door, rusted and squeaking (curious…) appeared in front of me, and I knocked three times and opened it and entered her instance.

I entered what I learned to be her home, and it broke my heart. She was sitting in a dirty abandoned-looking apartment in Light's Hope, based off the city skyline backdrop I saw through her window. Her jade eyes were sorrowful and her black hair was unbrushed, her cheeks were smudged with dust or dirt. Her clothes had rips and holes. She was barefoot, and had cuts on her legs and feet. This wasn't her avatar, I mean it was, but this was a girl who had scanned herself recently to have her digital avatar match her physical actuality. In the Everse you could be anywhere, in your heaven, and her self-esteem was such that the best reality she could envision for herself was the grimness she was already living. Five friends, all dead, three suicides.

She was an egg, my sister. She just didn't know it yet.
