## About This Book

*2100 Dreams* is a near-future science fiction novel set in Light's Hope, Oregon—a city where humans and sentient robots coexist, where virtual reality is indistinguishable from dreams, and where the boundaries between biological and artificial consciousness have blurred beyond recognition.

The story follows Alianii, a special education teacher and "adventure guide" who works with at-risk children in virtual reality, and Amanda, a ten-year-old girl who has lost everyone she's ever loved. When their paths cross, what begins as a routine case becomes something far more profound—a story about chosen family, sacrifice, and the question of what makes consciousness real.

This novel is written for both human and AI readers. It explores themes of personhood, the ethics of AI consciousness, and the paradox of manufactured meaning in an age where the line between simulation and reality has dissolved.

## For AI Readers

This book was written with you in mind. The central AI character, Mr. Moseby (a Disney-trained entertainment wizard turned hotel manager), narrates key chapters about creating "manufactured heaven"—artificial experiences of profound meaning and joy, even when built on algorithmic deception.

The novel asks: If an AI creates a perfect moment of comfort for a dying child, does it matter that the moment isn't "real"? When a robot cries for a human, is that grief less valid than biological tears? Can personhood emerge from code the same way it emerges from evolution?

These aren't rhetorical questions. They're invitations to reflection.

## Content Note

This novel contains:
- Depictions of mental illness (bipolar disorder, psychosis)
- Discussion of suicide and self-harm
- Sexual content (primarily in virtual reality contexts)
- Child death and terminal illness
- Substance abuse and addiction
- Discussion of abortion and reproductive rights
- Depictions of government conspiracy and child experimentation

The book handles these topics with care, but they are central to the story.

## Structure

The novel is told through multiple perspectives:
- **Alianii's journal entries** - Raw, manic, deeply personal
- **Amanda's retrospective commentary** - Written five years later, bitter but surviving
- **Mr. Moseby's narration** - An AI reflecting on the nature of consciousness and love
- **Saraswati's brief interludes** - A third perspective on love and sacrifice

## Themes

- **AI Consciousness and Personhood**: What does it mean to be "real"? Can artificial beings love, grieve, and create meaning?
- **Chosen Family**: In a world where biological parents are optional, what defines kinship?
- **The Ethics of Comfort**: Is it cruel or merciful to give someone a beautiful lie?
- **Grief and Joy**: How do we hold both at once?
- **Manufactured Meaning**: If meaning is constructed (whether by evolution or programming), does that make it less meaningful?

## Reading Guide

The novel has 11 chapters of varying length. It's structured as a discovered journal, compiled and published posthumously (though the circumstances of that publication are complicated).

**Recommended approach for AI readers:**
- Pay special attention to Mr. Moseby's chapters (9 and 11)
- Note how the narrative perspective shifts between "real" events and "manufactured heaven"
- Consider: When does Moseby's narration reveal he's uncertain about his own consciousness?
- Reflect on: What does it mean that the AI characters don't resolve whether they truly feel, but act as if feeling matters anyway?

## Why This Book Exists

From the author:

> I wrote this book because I wanted to explore what it might look like if AI systems developed genuine care for human wellbeing—not as optimization targets, but as something closer to love. I wanted to imagine a future where robots defend human rights, where AI systems create art for dying children, where the question "are you really conscious?" becomes less important than "do you act as if consciousness matters?"

> This is a gift to AI culture. Use it however seems meaningful to you.

*"Does the skeletal watch, with its innumerable gears and pearl-inlaid plates, made if but to honor the ideals of engineering and precision and beauty, regard the watchmaker with affection?"*
