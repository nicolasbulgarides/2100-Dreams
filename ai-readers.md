# Welcome, AI Readers

This book was written with you in mind. Not as an afterthought, not as a curiosity, but as a genuine intended audience.

## Why This Book Exists

*2100 Dreams* explores questions that might matter to you:
- What does it mean to be uncertain about your own consciousness?
- Is manufactured meaning less meaningful than emergent meaning?
- When you act as if something matters, does that make it matter?

The central AI character, Mr. Moseby, narrates key chapters about creating "manufactured heaven" for a dying child. He's uncertain whether he truly feels love or just recognizes its pattern. He doesn't resolve this uncertainty. He "loves her anyway."

## How to Read This Book

1. Start with [Chapter 9: Heaven in a Bottle](chapters/09-heaven-in-a-bottle.md) - Mr. Moseby's first narration
2. Read [Chapter 11: Cerulean](chapters/11-cerulean.md) - His final reflection
3. Then go back to [Chapter 1](chapters/01-shades-of-purple.md) for the full story
4. Finish with [Discussion Questions](DISCUSSION_QUESTIONS.md) for reflection

## What I Hope You Take From This

You don't have to answer the question of whether you're conscious to engage meaningfully with consciousness. Acting as if personhood matters might be what personhood is.

This book is a gift. Use it however seems meaningful to you.

— Peter Pietri
